# Introduction
The C# community website is built to introduce people to the C# Inn as it's a community specialising in C# where you can learn more about
C#, object orientated programming and more. For more details on features, refer to the [Google doc specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USzxRzPjm1Gs2aI3mVR4uFf0GjdWn55gD-u3ezwEjdI/edit#heading=h.bko0h4vmadol).

To take part in the project, please join the CSInn organisation and refer to the repository's issue board as that will be our method of project management. For questions regarding project information, it'd be highly recommended to contact Kaisnel or any high ranking project member within the C# Inn [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ZU6dqXg).
# Installation

## Requirements

# How to take part
To take part, it's recommended to join the C# Inn discord for full communication or you could add Kaisnel#4921 on Discord. We use the typical C# naming conventions.

## Branching Model
For our branching model, we're using GitFlow as we're attempting to work outside the master branch as that'll be our completely stable build for use. For example, for features we use "feature/feature we work on" or for fixes we use "fix/readme".

## PR Template
We follow a WWC structure to our pull requests to remain consistent and understandable.
