The C# community website is built to introduce people to the C# Inn as it's a community specialising in C# where you can learn more about
C#, object orienated programming and more. We also provide certain features such as:
- Projects
- Lessons taught by experienced developers/engineers
- Code reviews
- Questions that can be answered
- Mentors

And much more!

- C# will be the main language used to make the website as it's the main language that represents the community.
- Blazor will be used as it will allow us to use more of C# than what would normally be used within other Web UI frameworks.
- Git will act as our backlog
- GitHub issues board will act as project management where features can be implemented
- Azure pipelines will be used as our continous integration as it's made mainly for .NET
- Jenkins will be our continous delivery

If you wish to discuss these development tools, feel free to ask Kaisnel or any high ranking project member about the use or need for these tools.

Our Google doc will act as our [specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USzxRzPjm1Gs2aI3mVR4uFf0GjdWn55gD-u3ezwEjdI/edit#heading=h.bko0h4vmadol) for the project:

To take part in the project, please join the CSInn organisation and refer to the repository's issue board as that will be our method of project management.

For questions regarding project information, it'd be highly recommended to contact Kaisnel or any high ranking project member within the C# Inn [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ZU6dqXg).

This readme will be updated as the user interface is developed or other diagrams showcasing the project are developed in order to give a
better visual representation on what the project looks like in its current stage.
