# Introduction
The C# community website is built to introduce people to the C# Inn as it's a community specialising in C# where you can learn more about
C#, object orientated programming and more. For more details on features, refer to the [Google doc specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USzxRzPjm1Gs2aI3mVR4uFf0GjdWn55gD-u3ezwEjdI/edit#heading=h.bko0h4vmadol).

To take part in the project, please join the CSInn organisation and refer to the repository's issue board as that will be our method of project management. For questions regarding project information, it'd be highly recommended to contact Kaisnel or any high ranking project member within the C# Inn [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ZU6dqXg).
# Installation
We will be using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/client) which **requires** Visual Studio 2019 preview.
