# Introduction
The C# community website is built to introduce people to the C# Inn as it's a community specialising in C# where you can learn more about
C#, object orientated programming and more. For more details on features, refer to the [Google doc specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USzxRzPjm1Gs2aI3mVR4uFf0GjdWn55gD-u3ezwEjdI/edit#heading=h.bko0h4vmadol).
