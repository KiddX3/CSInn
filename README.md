# Introduction
The C# community website is built to introduce people to the C# Inn as it's a community specialising in C# where you can learn more about
C#, object orientated programming and more. For more details on features, refer to the [Google doc specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USzxRzPjm1Gs2aI3mVR4uFf0GjdWn55gD-u3ezwEjdI/edit#heading=h.bko0h4vmadol).

To take part in the project, please join the CSInn organisation and refer to the repository's issue board as that will be our method of project management. For questions regarding project information, it'd be highly recommended to contact Kaisnel or any high ranking project member within the C# Inn [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ZU6dqXg).
# Installation

## Requirements
- [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/client)
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (or 2019 with preview tick on)
- [.NET core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

Blazor allows us to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. 
To get started with Blazor, please refer to this [microsoft document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/blazor/get-started?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=visual-studio) using the guidance to install for the choice of your tooling.

# Branching Model
For our branching model, we're using GitFlow as we're attempting to work outside the master branch as that'll be our completely stable build for use. For example, for features we use "feature/feature we work on" or for fixes we use "fix/readme".
