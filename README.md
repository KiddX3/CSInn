This repository is part of the C# Inn Community Website where we as a community assist each other along with other programmers.
C# will be the main language used to make the website as it's the main language present in the community.
Blazor will be used as it will allow us to use more of C# than what would normally be used within other Web UI frameworks.

For a much more detailed explanation, please refer to the Google Doc:

To take part in the project, please join the CSInn organisation and refer to the repository's issue board as that will be our backlog.

For questions regarding project information, it'd be highly recommended to contact Kaisnel or any high ranking project member within the C# Inn discord.

This readme will be updated as the user interface is developed or other diagrams showcasing the project are developed in order to give a
better visual representation on what the project looks like.
