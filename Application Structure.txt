Foot note entirely here for how the actual file layout
will be for the entire solution. I will personally put what
the general layout is and hopefully get a feedback of where
things in general like databases will go to properly insert
intended items for functionality.

Things needed:
	-Controller
	-Database
	-Database Context
	-Possible additional file structures within the seperate projects???

Possible Ways to see denote what we might want in this structure?

[X] = Needs to be deleted
[O] = Needs to be added
[E] = Needs to be edited
[T] = Needs to be tested

(CSFILE) = C# Code File
(JSON) = Java Script Notation File
(CSHTML) = C# Html File. Mainly handles html, with some c# embedded
(Razor)

[1]: Entire Solution structure for view. More or less for easier visual view?

[2] Tests for the projects. As things are added more will have to be tested.
